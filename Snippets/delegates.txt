// a delegate is a type-safe pointer to a method
// and thereby a method reference (can have parameters and a return value)

// these lines define delegate types:
private delegate int IntDelegateWithResult(int a);
private delegate void StringDelegate(string s, string x);
private delegate void StringDelegateWithReference(ref string a, ref string b);

// any method with the same signature as the delegate can be assigned to the delegate

// delegates are used to:
// - promote reusability of code and implement flexibility
// - notify which method to call when an event is triggered
// - define callback methods
